        Todays lecture will be about networking concepts
        NETWORKING

        networks are mainly multihub connections

        OSI Modelts have around 7 layers, avoiding theoretical concepts
        stacking all OSI layers on top to be able to perform networking actions

        Physical -> converting bits
        Data Link (Mac and LLC) -> More like meta 
            deta, responsible for adressing the bits
            Something like source and destination + it only deals with
            one hub, not multiple ones on the same go
        Network -> IP sits on top of MAC Layer. The magical part here that is
            different from Data Link, is that the destination adress
            is not the hub after it but rather the ultimate destination

            The IP adress doesnt change when the packets transfer, while 
            the mac changes from the sender, to the hubs and all the way
            to the target

            Mac adress sends

        Transport -> to ensure realiability (UDP or TCP) TCP is a protocol
            that has meta deta to ensure reliability
            
        Session -> its about ports, Source port and destination port, you have
            to import these destinations in UDP, TCP. Ports are like the way
            the data is directed to
            and usually the source port is randomly generated

        Presentation -> more like with application, used for coating protocols

        Application -> has DNS resolver, your OS has it

        know what the DNS is,


        Read about domain names as HW
