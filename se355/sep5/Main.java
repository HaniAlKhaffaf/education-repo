/* Instructions data -> CPU -> Computer 
    Instructions are low level, so we need a solution
    CPU uses low level language, while java is a high language,
    to convert it, we use compilation so we translate the high level
    language to the low level language so the CPU can understand


    Java code -> compiled to something called Byte code -> Instructions through JVM -> CPU
    the CPU doesnt understand the byte code, so JVM translates the byte code
    to the CPU, the JVM sees the byte code only and not the compiled code

    Byte code inputs -> instructions is the output by JVM

    If statements recap

    Switch recap (Switch is a bit faster than if in the case where 
    you are comparing using the == comparator, otherwise it wont make 
    difference, and the difference is very slight, made for optimization)

    x++ and ++x recap

    if(x++ > 10) {
        System.out.print("True");
    }else {
        ...."false"
    }

    While and for recapped

    HW read about forEach loop in java and do-while loop as well
